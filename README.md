# MyFavoriteAnime ![](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=angular)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.1.
This Angular project uses the <a href="https://angular.io/guide/router">Angular Router</a> to navigate
between different <a href="https://angular.io/guide/component-overview">components</a> like <i>home</i> and <i>about</i>. 
The <a href="https://angular.io/guide/http">HTTP client</a> is also used to fetch data from a REST API. 
This HTTP client is injected into the service that fetches the data and therefore it is used too in the component that renders the data.
<a href="https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection"> Angular dependency injection</a> is used to inject the HTTP client service into the component. 
The views are rendered using the <a href="https://angular.io/api/common/NgIf">NgIf</a> directive, now known as <a href="https://blog.angular-university.io/angular-if/">&#64;If</a>. 
The <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli">Angular CLI</a> is used to build and test this project.
